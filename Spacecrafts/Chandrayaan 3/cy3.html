        <h5>
          The operations of the Chandrayaan-3 lander on the lunar surface will align with the lunar day. The lunar day spans approximately 14.5 Earth days and is succeeded by an equally long night. During the daylight period, the lander will establish communication with the propulsion module (PM), it can also directly communicate with ground stations on Earth (Chandrayaan-2 orbiter can act as a backup link). The lander and rover will carry out surface surveys and conduct various scientific experiments. Meanwhile the propulsion module stays in orbit acting as a link between the lander and ground stations. It also has one payload on it called SHAPE.<br><br><br><br>
        </h5>

        <div class="solid-line"></div>

        <h3>Propulsion system - </h3>

        <h5>
          The Chandrayaan-3  propulsion system incorporates a combination of different liquid-propellant engines, each serving specific purposes with varying thrust capabilities.<br><br>

          I) On the propulsion module (PM): <br>
          For trans lunar injection from earth orbit, trajectory corrections and lunar orbit insertion, an engine with 440N of thrust is employed. This engine is pressure fed burning MMH(fuel) and MON3(oxidiser). The PM also has an array of lower thrust thrusters. This whole system enables precise adjustments to the spacecraft's trajectory.<br><br>

          II) On the lander:<br>
          To facilitate a soft landing on the lunar surface, 4 throttleable engines with a thrust of 800N each are utilized. These engines are also pressure fed and burn MMH and MON3. This system differs from the Chandrayaan-2 lander which had 5 engines (4 throttleable and the central engine being fixed thrust). The central engine did the final touchdown to mitigate lunar dust blow back on the lander instruments. The central or fifth engine was added last minute during Chandrayaan-2 as the original design was always 4-engined.<br><br>

          According to Dr. S. Somanath, Chairman, ISRO - <i>"Five engines were OK with the earlier mass of the lander but now we've enhanced the mass by nearly 200kg. Also, given its weight now, we have to necessarily fire a minimum of two engines to do the landing, and cannot land with a single engine."</i> Hence the central fifth engine was removed from the Chandrayaan-3 lander design. 

          For stabilization and orientation purposes, the system employs 8 engines with a thrust of 58N each.

        <h3>Power Supply System - </h3>

        <h5>
          Chandrayaan-3 lander is set to become one of the pioneering spacecraft to touch down in the high latitudes of the Moon. In this region, specific constraints arise due to the maximum angle at which the Sun appears above the horizon as the landing location being in the south polar region where the sun remains quite low in the horizon. The lander is designed to tolerate a deviation of up to 12° from the vertical axis, enabling it to further mitigate this situation.<br><br>
          Such challenging conditions impose additional limitations on the layout possibilities for the solar panels, which serve as the primary source of electrical power. Hence 3 sides of the lander are almost entirely covered in solar panels wherever possible. The total solar panel area has also been increased from the Chandrayaan-2 lander. The rover is also equipped with it's own fold out solar panel array with one side almost completely covered in panel and half on the other side. The PM also has it's own solar panel.
          All of this is backed by batteries and energy management systems.
