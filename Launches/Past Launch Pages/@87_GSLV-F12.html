     <h4>About the Launch</h4>

     <p>
      GSLV-F12/NVS-01 mission was accomplished successfully on Monday, May 29, 2023. This Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) mission deployed NVS-01 navigation satellite, weighing about 2232 kg, into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. The vehicle lifted off at 10:42 hours IST from the second launch pad at SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota and injected the satellite after about 19 minutes of flight.

      NVS-01 is the first of the second-generation satellites envisaged for the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services. NVS series of satellites will sustain and augment the NavIC with enhanced features. This series incorporates L1 band signals additionally to widen the services. For the first time, an indigenous atomic clock will be flown in NVS-01.

      <h4>About the Payload</h4>

      <p>
        NVS-01 is the first in the series of second generation navigation satellite and the ninth satellite in the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), with an alternate name of, IRNSS-1J. It will augment the existing satellite and bolster the capability of the NavIC constellation by adding more robustness and new features. ISRO already launched IRNSS 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H and 1I. The satellite is intended to replace IRNSS-1G and augment the constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites after IRNSS-1I.<br><br>
        NVS-01 has two types of payloads, navigation payload and the ranging payload. The navigation payload transmits navigation service signals to the users. This payload is operating in L1 band, L5 band and S band. A highly stable Rubidium atomic clock is part of the navigation payload of the satellite. Failure of the imported Rubidium atomic clocks across the fleet of previous generation of satellite led to the creation of an indigenous option. NVS-01 is the first navigation satellite to host the indigenous clock. <br><br>
        The ranging payload consists of transponder which is operated in CDMA mode for two-way range measurements. The IRNSS satellites continuously emits time stamped navigation signals, which are received by the ground-based user receivers. The information is then processed by the receivers to derive their own position, velocity and time. The system provides seamless, uninterrupted services under all weather conditions. The new generation of navigation satellite features a new and improved encryption system for bolstering the communication of the satellite specially for the restricted users.
